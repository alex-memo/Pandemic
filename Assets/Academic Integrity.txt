Statement of Commitment to Academic Integrity
As a member of the Ontario Tech University community, I share our communityâ€™s commitment
to the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence in all dimensions of our work.
I therefore promise that I will not lie, cheat, or use any unauthorized aids or assistance to
complete any of my essays, assignments, and exams. I further promise that I will not offer any
unauthorized assistance to any of my fellow students, and I promise that I will not ask any of my
fellow students for unauthorized assistance. I promise that the work I submit is my own and that
where I have drawn on the work of others, I have included proper attribution for my sources.
